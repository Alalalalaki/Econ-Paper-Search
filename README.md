A simple web app to search for **economics papers** in **economics journals**.

https://econ-paper-search.streamlitapp.com/

Why not Google Search?
- one often gets noneconomics papers in the results
- one cannot select for the journals
- one cannot have results ordered by published year
- one cannot see a hundred of papers or more at one page

The data is gathered from RePEc and will be updated monthly (at 1st day of each month). The webscrapping code is not included.

The set of journals is selected by my personal interests. If you want to see a journal that are not in the selection choices, you are welcome to raise an issue about it.

**Caution**: due to some unknown reasons of streamlit, sometimes some browsers will not work correctly for the app and the page keeps blank. One can try either clearing the cache/cookies or simply using another browser.
